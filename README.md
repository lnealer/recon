# Recon Project

This program is can be run in multiple ways: either with or without an argument and from the command line or not. The first way is to run it from the command line with or without argument. It accepts a file path to the users recon.in file. For convenience I have included a recon.in file in the scripts folder. To run the program on this file, simply type "python3 recon.py recon.in" from the command line in the scripts folder. Alternatively you can simply run "python3 recon.py" and the program will prompt you to enter a file path to recon.in. After running, a recon.out file will be produced in the same location as the recon.in file that was input.

You can also run the program from your file manager. The program will prompt you to input a file path to recon.in, and then create a recon.out file in the same file location as recon.in.
