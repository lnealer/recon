# Recon Project

This program is designed to be run from the command line. It accepts a file path to the users recon.in file. For convenience I have included a recon.c file in the scripts folder. To run the program on this ile, simply type "python recon.py recon.in" from the command line in the scripts folder.

After running, a recon.out file will be produced in the same location as the recon.in file that was input.
